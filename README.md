# XRMaze
 
My experience building the maze was not too bad. Beyond figuring out what the XR rig is now called, XR Origin, and having to navigate differences in how layers are used in newer versions as opposed to what Professor Allison showed, such as general layers not appearing in the interactive layer mask drop-down, the process was fairly straightforward. I continued with the theme of my Capstone, and downloaded the Snaps Warehouse assets to create my maze along with a keycard asset pack and a apartment furnishing asset pack. They were easy to snap into place. I used Week seven's assignment to remember how to add an animation so that my door didn't just disappear. I liked that I was able to add instructions with TextMeshPro to create the story of the maze - find the keycard to open the door to the break room. I definitely like the assets in the Unity Asset Store as a resource to create the things I might not otherwise be able to create. Overall, the process was tedious but fun. I feel like I'm starting to understand the concepts much better.
